# AMOEBA+ charge flux database

## old charge flux database
This database will be modified and expanded as we have already obtained valence parameters, so we only upload the old 
dipole moments by PBE0/aug-cc-pvdz and our previous CF parameters here.
(Match the data in this Ref.:
Xudong Yang, Chengwen Liu, Brandon D. Walker, and Pengyu Ren , "Accurate description of molecular dipole surface with charge flux implemented for molecular mechanics", J. Chem. Phys. 153, 064103 (2020) https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0016376)

## New charge flux database
The new database has already been expanded to cover about 570 molecules right now. All the configurations are calculated 
by MP2/aug-cc-pvtz
