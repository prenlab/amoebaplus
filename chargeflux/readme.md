## Update

* Old charge flux database
This database will be modified and expanded as we have already obtained valence parameters.

* New charge flux database
The new database has already been expanded to cover about 570 molecules right now. All the configurations are calculated at MP2/aug-cc-pvtz level of theory
(No. 455 & 460 & 474 have some problems during the Poltype, currently not considered)
